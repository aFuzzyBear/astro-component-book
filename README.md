# [Astro](https://astro.build) Component Book

Project Lead : [jonathantneal](https://github.com/jonathantneal)

## ðŸ§  Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a Component Explorer and Documentation facility to work with and alongside the Astro framework.
Taking inspiration from [Storybook.js](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook), a powerful and fully composite system that provides developers with means to create *Stories* for each component that makes up the UI for that particular application.

For this project we wish to create a similar facility to help developers utilising Astro, to create a powerful Component driven narrative. 

Using Astro's unique ability to render content statically, and components from a whole host of UI frameworks. We see the need that soon within the Astro ecosystem, developers would be wanting a similar experience that is offered by Storybook.

An editor and documentation tool that would help enforce the design principles and systems for their application. Helping them to craft and create their components.
